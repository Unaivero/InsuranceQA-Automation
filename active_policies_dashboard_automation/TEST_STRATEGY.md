# Active Policies Dashboard Automation Test Strategy

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test strategy for the Active Policies Dashboard Automation project. It defines the overall approach to testing, including test levels, test types, and test environments.

## 2. Testing Objectives

The primary objectives of our testing efforts are:

- Validate that the Active Policies Dashboard functions correctly across all supported browsers and devices
- Ensure all critical business functions work as expected
- Verify data integrity across the UI, API, and database layers
- Identify and prevent regressions as new features are added
- Support rapid release cycles through automation

## 3. Test Levels

### 3.1. UI Testing

UI tests validate the application from an end-user perspective, focusing on:

- User workflows and journeys
- Form validations
- UI responsiveness and functionality
- Visual appearance and layout
- Cross-browser compatibility

**Key UI Test Suites:**
- Login functionality
- Dashboard filtering and search
- Data export functionality
- Visual regression testing

### 3.2. API Testing

API tests validate the application's RESTful APIs, focusing on:

- Endpoint functionality and correctness
- Request/response validation
- Error handling and status codes
- Authentication and authorization
- Performance and reliability

**Key API Test Suites:**
- Policy management endpoints
- User authentication
- Data retrieval and filtering
- Error handling and edge cases

### 3.3. Database Testing

Database tests validate data integrity and storage, focusing on:

- Data persistence
- Data consistency across layers
- Database schema validation
- Transaction integrity
- Data retrieval performance

**Key Database Test Suites:**
- Policy data validation
- User data management
- Data integrity across UI, API, and database

## 4. Test Types

### 4.1. Functional Testing

- Validate core business functionality
- Test critical user workflows
- Ensure feature completeness

### 4.2. Integration Testing

- Validate interactions between components
- Test data flow between layers
- Ensure system cohesiveness

### 4.3. Visual Testing

- Detect unintended UI changes
- Verify layout and appearance
- Ensure consistent user experience

### 4.4. Data-Driven Testing

- Test multiple scenarios with different data sets
- Validate boundary conditions
- Ensure consistent behavior across data variations

### 4.5. Security Testing

- Validate authentication and authorization
- Test input validation and sanitization
- Verify data privacy and protection

## 5. Test Environments

### 5.1. Development Environment

- Purpose: Early detection of issues during development
- Frequency: Continuous integration on each pull request
- Data: Test data, regularly refreshed

### 5.2. Staging Environment

- Purpose: Pre-production validation in a production-like environment
- Frequency: Before each release candidate
- Data: Production-like data, anonymized

### 5.3. Production Environment

- Purpose: Smoke tests and monitoring
- Frequency: After each deployment
- Data: Production data (read-only tests only)

## 6. Test Data Management

### 6.1. Test Data Sources

- Static test data files (CSV, JSON)
- Dynamic data generation using JavaFaker
- Database seeding scripts
- Environment-specific configurations

### 6.2. Test Data Principles

- Data isolation between test runs
- Test data versioning
- Regular data refresh
- Data cleanup after test execution

## 7. Test Execution Strategy

### 7.1. Local Development

- Developers run relevant tests before submitting pull requests
- Focus on tests related to changed functionality
- Quick feedback loop

### 7.2. Continuous Integration

- All tests run on every pull request
- Full regression suite runs nightly
- Test results reported via Allure

### 7.3. Release Testing

- Complete test suite execution before each release
- Cross-browser testing for UI components
- Performance validation for critical operations

## 8. Test Prioritization

Tests are prioritized based on:

### 8.1. Risk Level

- Critical business functions
- Areas with complex logic
- Features with high user impact

### 8.2. Change Frequency

- Recently modified features
- Areas with historical defects
- New functionality

### 8.3. User Impact

- Core user journeys
- High-visibility features
- Revenue-generating functionality

## 9. Reporting and Metrics

### 9.1. Test Reports

- Allure reports for detailed test execution information
- Daily test execution summary
- Trend analysis for test stability

### 9.2. Key Metrics

- Test coverage percentage
- Test pass/fail rate
- Defect detection efficiency
- Test execution time

## 10. Maintenance Strategy

### 10.1. Test Code Reviews

- All test code undergoes peer review
- Focus on maintainability and best practices
- Regular architecture reviews

### 10.2. Refactoring

- Regular refactoring of test code
- Updates for new application features
- Technical debt management

### 10.3. Documentation

- Comprehensive documentation of test approach
- Clear test naming conventions
- Comments for complex test scenarios
